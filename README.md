# Depth Map and Point Cloud Generation from Stereo Vision

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of calibrating a stereo camera system, generating a depth map using stereo vision techniques, and converting that depth map into a point cloud using the Open3D library. It aims to provide an accessible implementation for beginners interested in 3D vision and point cloud processing.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Open3D
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy open3d matplotlib
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
   cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
   ```

2. **Open the Colab notebook or run the Python script:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook your_colab_notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Camera Calibration

Camera calibration is essential for correcting lens distortion and obtaining accurate camera parameters for depth estimation. The calibration process involves capturing multiple images of a known pattern (e.g., a chessboard) and using them to compute the camera matrix and distortion coefficients.

### Calibration Steps

1. Capture multiple images of a chessboard pattern from different angles.
2. Use OpenCV to detect corners and calibrate the camera with `cv2.calibrateCamera`.
3. Save the computed camera matrix and distortion coefficients.

### Camera Parameters

- **Camera Matrix:**
  \[
  K = \begin{bmatrix}
  f_x & 0 & c_x \\
  0 & f_y & c_y \\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- **Distortion Coefficients:**
  - A list of coefficients that describe lens distortion.

## Depth Map Generation

### Stereo Vision Concept

Stereo vision uses two or more cameras to capture images of the same scene from different viewpoints. By comparing the differences between the images, we compute depth information.

### Steps to Generate Depth Map

1. Capture synchronized images from two calibrated cameras.
2. Rectify images using OpenCV's stereo rectification functions.
3. Compute the disparity map using OpenCVâ€™s `StereoBM` or `StereoSGBM`.
4. Convert the disparity map to a depth map.

## Point Cloud Generation

### Creating the Point Cloud

1. Create an Open3D camera intrinsic object from the camera matrix.
2. Use `create_from_depth_image` to create the point cloud.

### Visualizing the Point Cloud

Use Open3D or other visualization libraries to inspect the generated point cloud.

## Usage

1. Run the calibration and depth map generation script.
2. View the resulting point cloud.

## Common Issues

- **Negative Depth Values:** Check for valid disparity values and ensure proper alignment of stereo images.
- **Visualization Errors:** Save the point cloud to a file and visualize it locally if using Google Colab.
